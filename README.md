# About
Just adds a simple quiver, no more, no less.
Can be used to select the arrow you want to fire mid-combat.
dunno what else to write here, just look at the feature list

## Features
- Quiver that can hold up to 256 arrows
- Mechanics similar to the Bundle
  - Fill level is determined by amount of items, not by stacks
  - Input and output items, by right-clicking the quiver with arrows
- Picked up items will automatically go into the quiver, if there is space
- Select an arrow type, by holding down shift and scrolling the mouse wheel
- Dyeable with near infinite colour combinations using the vanilla colouring system
- Renders different amounts of arrows, based on fill level (item and in-world)
- Compatible with ['Trinkets'](https://modrinth.com/mod/trinkets)

## Future Plans
- Add some config options
